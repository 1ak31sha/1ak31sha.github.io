# Lakeisha Lab

my personal blog made using Hexo.io

start server with live reload
```bash
$ hexo server --draft --open
```

generate the statics when you want to push the live update
``` bash
$ hexo generate
```

since my site is hosted on github, making the updates live is as simple as pushing to master
``` bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m'pushing update'
$ git push
```
