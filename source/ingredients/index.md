A whole food containing fat and oil. very versatile, soak in warm water when blending. Use in cheeze dips, pasta sauce, indian currys, mac and nooch sauce etc

bulk barn has this and it is amazing. comes in powder form. Great for seasonings and tofu and potentially anywhere you would use vegetable broth.
##### Chard
##### Clove

##### Dates

##### Fenugreek
##### Figs

##### Galangal
This one can be hard to find. Sometimes the TNT on Cherry Road has it, but the TNT in mississauaga is more a gaurantee. You can also try Sunny's or Bestco or any other Chinese/Thai Grocery stores.
The taste is quite different than Ginger. Its more sweet and bitter rather than spicy like ginger. It can also be called Thai Ginger.
