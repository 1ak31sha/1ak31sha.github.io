### Method

1. Boil 4 potatoes until they are soft enough for you to stick your fork in
them. Then remove them and carefully peel the skin away.

2. Add the flour and combine well until you form a dough ball. Add more flour if
needed for the dough ball to not be too sticky. Let it sit for 10 minutes covered.

3. Split the dough into 4 balls, and roll each one into a long piece. Cut into
gnocchi sizes are however you prefer. From experience, lean towards the smaller
side as they will expand. You can use a gnocchi roller or a fork to get that nice design on them.

4. At this point the gnocchis are ready to cook, but I usually start the sauce now
