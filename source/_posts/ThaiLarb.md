This TVP based salad features Mint, Lime, Culantro, Agave, and hot peppers!

Allow me to introduce you to Thai Larb! The mint and cullantro give it a wonderfully refreshing flavour. The hot peppers, agave syrup, soy sauce and broth round it out and pack in the flavour. TVP is used to get that ground protein-like texture!
