Part 2
7. Use a Dhal gutney or electric hand blender to break down further the split peas.
8. Heat the oil in separate pan and add cumin seeds. Once they are getting dark brown, add the garlic. Cumin seeds may be black.
9. Fry the garlic and let it get light brown. Then pour all oil, seeds and garlic into the pot.
10. Continue to boil down and add water until desired split pea consistency is reached. It should be very smooth like a squash soup.
You can make it thick and serve on its own or with rice, or thin(add more water) and use it as a soup broth
11. Boil down to final desired water content and turn off heat.
12. Salt to taste and done!
