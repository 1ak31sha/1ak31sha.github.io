***Servings***: 4 large portions
**Prep-time**:
**Cook time**:

### Recipe

- 2 cans of coconut milk ðŸŒ´
- 1/4 - 1/2 cup of my homemade Thai curry paste, or use less for store bought in most cases
- 1 tablespoon avocado oil or other high heat oil
- 1 pack of 2 rice noodles, medium thickness, both blocks in the pack
- 1 pack bean sprouts or about 2 cups
- 2 packs double frozen tofu
- 1 tablespoon chicken style broth (vegan) or vegetable broth
- 2 Japanese sweet potato
- 1 pack Thai basil
- 1 lime
- coconut/palm sugar to taste
- salt/tamari to taste


### Method

1. Soak the rice noddles in room temperature water until later when they will be added.
2. Defrost the double frozen tofu. Press the tofu, then soak in the broth. Bake
on stone at about 400F for 45 minutes.  let it get golden brown and it should
come off the stone easier.
3. Dice medium to small cubes of Japanese Sweet potato. Bake at 400F for about 45 minutes as well.
4. Pick all leaves off Thai basil stems and wash leaves. Keep the flowers too
5. Fry the curry paste in the oil ~5 minutes
6. Add the coconut milk and simmer. Add half the Thai basil. Add the palm sugar, tamari, and lime juice to taste.
7. Add the rice noodles. I like my noodles swimming in sauce a bit, so I add a bit of water. Cook noodles to desired softness.
8. Turn off heat, immediately add bean sprouts, tofu, sweet potato, and remaining Thai basil,
9. Serve with vegan hoisin sauce or hot chilli flakes or crushed peanuts
