This TVP based salad features Mint, Lime, Culantro, Agave, and hot peppers!

It is the lesser known Thai Larb! The mint and cullantro give it
a wonderfully refreshing flavour. The hot peppers, agave syrup,
soy sauce and broth round it out and pack in the flavour. TVP is
used to get that ground protein-like texture!
