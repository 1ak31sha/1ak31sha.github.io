### Thai Larb (Veganized)

Today I'd like to share with you a recipe that I've veganized myself!

It is the lesser known Thai Larb! The mint and cullantro give it
a wonderfully refreshing flavour. The hot peppers, agave syrup,
soy sauce and broth round it out and pack in the flavour. TVP is
used to get that ground protein-like texture!
