Tomato based curry using whole spices and cashews

***Servings***: 4
***Prep-time***: 30 min
***Cook time***: 30 min


### Recipe

This recipe is mainly for the sauce. The options for what veg and protein to add
to it are up to you! Traditionally, I would say a paneer style seasoning on tofu
is the classic, but I find it works great for Aloo Gobi(potatoes and cauliflower) too.

<hr>
***Part 2 ingredients:***
- 6 tomatoes or 1 can tomato paste
- 1/4 cup cashews
- 1 red onion
- 1 green cardamom pod
- 1 stick of cinnamon
- 1 Bay leaf
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 tea spoon salt

<hr>
*** Part 2 ingredients:***
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 table spoon methi
- 3 deseeded chillis
- 1 table spoon peanut oil


### Method

1. If you choose to add tofu, cauliflower or potatoes, I'd recommend using the oven and getting that going first.
I like to bake potatoes and cauliflower on a pizza stone for this recipe @400 F for about 40 minutes.
2. Add all of the part 2 ingredients to a pot and bring to boil. Then let it simmer on medium.

3. If serving with rice, now's a good time to get your rice cooker going. If
serving with Roti, i'd prep the dough now and cook them at the very end just
before serving.
4. Chop and fry the third ingredients, adding the garlic last. Turn to low when garlic is cooked.

5. Back to the boiling ingredients. They should be about done by now. When the
cashews are soft, blend the mixture, removing the bayleafs first
6. Remove the fryed ingredients from heat or add some water and add the mixture
to it(prevent mixtures from splashing and bubbling). Add back to heat and add
the pototes, cauliflower, tofu or other. Cook down or add water for desired
consistency. Salt and pepper to taste.
