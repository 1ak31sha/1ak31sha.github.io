My own Ice cream recipe after much experimentation! Creamy ü••  base has üçåtaste  not  tü••t aste at all!

### Recipe

- 1 can chilled coconut milk or coconut cream ü••
- 1 brown spots banana üçå
- 1 table spoon agave syrup
- 1 table spoon corn syrup
- 1 table spoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 teaspoon xanathan gum

### Method

1. Make sure the coconut milk can has been in a cold fridge (or near the back) for at least a day.
2. Open the can and scoop off the cream which has solidified and risen above the water. Add to a bowl
3. Do not add the coconut water at the bottom of the can, use it for something else like chia pudding!
4. Add the sugar, agave, corn syrup, vanilla.
5. Heat the ingredients using a double bowl technique. This will remove clumps in the coconut cream.
6. Add to the blender, add the banana and blend until smooth, pour into freezable bowl.
6. Freeze for 2 hours, then take out and stir.
7. Freeze for another half hour then take out and stir.
8. Freeze for another half hour then take out and stir.
9. Freeze for another half hour then take out and stir.
9. Freeze for another half hour then take out and stir.
10. Enjoy!!

### Notes

- Xanathan gum can be found at freshco or online. I have the one from Bob's mill brand.
- Agave Syrup can be found in most high end grocery stores now like Loblaws, Sobeys, Whole Foods etc
- For the Coconut milk, I recommend the Aroy-D brand, the one in green can.
