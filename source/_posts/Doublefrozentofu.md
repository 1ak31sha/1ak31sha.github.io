The best way to make tofu. You haven't discovered tofu until you try this, straight up ðŸ’¯

***Servings***: 2 (depends on brand of tofu that you buy and how hungry you are ðŸ¤£ )
***Prep-time***: 25 mins
***Freeze time***:  8 hours
***Thaw time***: 10 hours

By freezing the tofu, you change the structure of it! It allows you to press out
much more water, which means the tofu can now act like a sponge and absorb any
flavors you want!!


### Recipe

- 1 package medium tofu

### Method

1. Freeze the tofu. right in the package it comes in.
2. Thaw the tofu. I find it takes about 5 hours, but depends on your room temperature.
3. Freeze it again!
4. Thaw it again when you are ready to use it. I like to keep to a bunch of tofu
packs that were frozen and thawed once in the freeze so they are ready to go
when i want tofu! Its also a good idea to use a sharpie on them so you can keep
track of how many times they've been frozen(I buy a lot and am starting to get
them mixed up)
- You can also use the thaw function on your microwave if you dont have time to
  wait.
5. Open the tofu pack and drain the water.
6. Press the tofu. I like to slice holes in the plastic container and press the
tofu directly in its package, the holes allow the water to drain instantly. And
the package help prevent the tofu from breaking.  Once most the water is
pressed, i take it out and press it further with my
hands, carefully not to break the tofu.

7. Slice you tofu into cubes, or whatever you want. For chicken pieces style,
rip it into pieces, allowing it to rip naturally in the cracks that it has.
8. Season your tofu. Some suggestions below!
