Make your own spicy thai curry paste that will last for weeks in the fridge!

This curry paste will resemble a Red Thai curry, but its color can vary depending on your pepper choice.
### Recipe

*Equal parts of:*
- Galangal (never heard of it? pictures below)
- Fresh Turmeric
- Onion
- Garlic
- Lemongrass
- Keffir Lime rind (or keffir lime leaves if you cant find)
- Dried red chillies üå∂ (omit if you're going for a green curry)
- Fresh hot peppers of your liking (I like to use wiri wiri, but Thai bird chillies are the OG)
- Fresh Ginseng (I've yet to find this in Toronto and have always omitted it.)

*Half portion compared with above ingredients:*
- Coriander seeds
- Your choice of oil. I recommend grapeseedüçá.

### Method

When I make this, I try to make as much as possible! So I choose an ingredient size that will fill my blender to the top.

1. Cut the ingredients into small pieces so that they will blender easier, unless you have a beast of a blender!
2. Add everything to your blender and blend well! Try to get it blended to the point where there are no more strands of lemongrass fiber. Add a bit more oil or water if you need to help it blend. MY blender comes with a plastic rod that I jam into the blender while its going to push everything down and help it along.
3. Store in fridge. Can last at least 3 weeks.


##### Galangal
This one can be hard to find. Sometimes the TNT on Cherry Road has it, but the TNT in mississauaga is more a gaurantee. You can also try Sunny's or Bestco or any other Chinese/Thai Grocery stores.
The taste is quite different than Ginger. Its more sweet and bitter rather than spicy like ginger. It can also be called Thai Ginger.
