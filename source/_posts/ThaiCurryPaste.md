Make your own spicy thai curry paste that will last for weeks in the fridge!

This curry paste will resemble a Red Thai curry, but its color can vary depending on your pepper choice.
### Recipe

*Equal parts of:*
- 50 g Galangal (never heard of it? pictures below)
- 50 g Fresh Turmeric
- 50 g Onion
- 50 g Garlic
- 50 g Lemongrass(optional)
- one Keffir Lime rind (or 2 keffir lime leaves if you cant find)(optional)
- 50 deseed dried red chillies ðŸŒ¶ (sounds like a lot but trust me it wont be very spicy - you will deseed)
- 50 g Fresh Ginseng (optional. Hard to find so ive often omitted it. Try to find at TNT)
- 2 tablespoon Coriander seeds
- 1 tablespoon salt


### Method

When I make this, I try to make as much as possible! So I choose an ingredient
size that will fill my blender to the top. 50 grams of each ingredient fills my
vitamix. You could cut the recipe in half if you want just enough paste for one
recipe.

1. Cut the ingredients into small pieces so that they will blender easier,
unless you have a beast of a blender!

2. Place all ingredients except the coriander seeds into a large pot with
enough water to almost cover the ingredients. Bring to boil on high for about 25
minutes. Top up the water a bit if it all evaporates to prevent anything burning to the bottom.

3. Get a small pan and roast the coriander seeds until brown but not black. Then
add them to the mixture in the pot as well. (Do this early on, don't wait the 25
minutes to add this)

4. Add everything to your blender and blend well! Try to get it blended to the
point where there are no more strands of lemon grass fiber. Add a bit more water
if you need to help it blend. My blender comes with a plastic rod that I
jam into the blender while its going to push everything down and help it along.
But since we boiled the ingredients, you should not have any issues.

5. Store in fridge. Can last at least 3 weeks.

##### Galangal
This one can be hard to find. Sometimes the TNT on Cherry Road has it, but the TNT in mississauaga is more a gaurantee. You can also try Sunny's or Bestco or any other Chinese/Thai Grocery stores.
The taste is quite different than Ginger. Its more sweet and bitter rather than spicy like ginger. It can also be called Thai Ginger.
