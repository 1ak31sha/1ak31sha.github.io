#### Avocado Cream (optional)
- 3/4 cup raw cashews
- 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves
- 1 large garlic clove
- 1/2 cup water, or as needed
- 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice
- 2 tablespoons avocado
- 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

### Method

1. Chop the sweet potato into small cubes and put the on a pizza stone(no oil) and bake @420 F for ~30 minutes. If you dont have a pizza stone, try parchment paper or maybe resort to a bit of oil.
2. If you have an instant pot or pressure cooker, get your black beans ready too. I usually do 30 minutes from dry in the insta. You can use canned otherwise.
3. Get started with the sauce. Get the broth in your pot and put it on medium to low heat.
4. Add all the other ingredients and cook for 5-10 minutes until everything is mixed well. Salt to taste and turn off heat.
5. Add the chopped onion,spinach, garlic and adobo peppers to a wok or large pot and cook on medium to low until onions are to your liking.
6. The Sweet potato and black beans should be about done by now. Add these and the rest on the ingredients and cook another 3-5 minutes.
7. Spread a layer of your enchilada sauce on the bottom of a deep baking dish.
8. Put a scoop of filling on each enchilada and roll them up. Get them in the dish and pour the remaining sauce on them.
9. Bake at 350 for 30 mins.

10. If you are doing the avocado cream, now is the time.
11. Soak the cashews in hot water for at least 15 minutes up to an hour.
12. Put all ingredients in a blender and blend long time till smooth.

Damn, my mouth is watering just after writing this recipe down. Its really not
that much work and is super comforting food and super healthy too. Also, this
dish does really well as leftovers, some people might even prefer it reheated.
So its a great meal prep candidate. Good way to get that spinach too. I started
using the whole bunch of spinach in an effort not to let anything go bad and to
get more vitamins - and it still taste great! The spinach wilts down a lot
anyways, so 1 cup isn't that much, which is what the original recipe called for.

- you can bake it without the sauce to get it cripsier and add the sauce after and then bake a lil more.
