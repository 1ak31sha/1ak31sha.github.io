Hearty and simple yet Flavourful Scrambled Tofu!

This dish is so delicious, I promise you will prefer it over scrambled eggs
It also has more protein, no LDL cholesterol, and Tofu has a much longer expiry date, so its easy to keep the 
ingredients on hand!

#### Recipe

- Medium size onion
- 4 garlic cloves
- 1 tablespoon avocodo oil or other high smoke point oil
- 3/4 package of firm tofu
- one of your best tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon ground tumeric
- 1 teaspoon ground Cumin
- 1 teaspoon Salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground Thyme
- half a thai bird chilli (optional)

Dice your onion and tomatoe, and mince your garlic (and chilli if using)
The reason i recommned a good tomatoe, is that I find this is one of the vegetables where
organic or better yet homegrown, makes a huge difference
Add the oil. Set stove to high to get oil heated quickly, then bring it back down to 4/10
If your oil smokes(perhaps you are using olive or veg oil) throw it out and start again
Add in your onion first. Fry for a few min, then add in the garlic. Fry for another minute.
Add in the tomatoe. I add the whole thing, skin and all. I chop it in hand over a plate, as to not loose any juices to my wooden cutting board
If you have frozen tomatoes, just microwave on a plate for 4 minutes and do the same
Add the chilli pepper now as well if using. I just use half since i dont want to overpower the other flavours, but if you are in the mood for it, add the whole thing! or maybe 2 chillies!
While you are letting it cook down for a few minutes, you can start adding the spices
Add the Salt, black pepper, Cumin and Thyme.
Then, start crumbling in your tofu.
Sprinkle the Tumeric powder over the tofu now to give it that color(and also its anti-inflamatory and anti-oxidant properties!)
Mix everything down and cook for a couple more minutes, until all tomatoe juice is absorbed/evaporated

Its done! Well, it probably is, but do a taste test, and adjust the salt or spices to your liking
