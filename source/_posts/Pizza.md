Find out my secret technique to making a cripsy Thin crust pizza!

**Servings**: 1-4 medium thin-crust pizzas
**Prep-time**: 30 min
**Cook time**: 15 min per pizza

This is a simple dough recipe, but its the cooking technique that really makes this pizza stand out as one
of my favorite personally developed recipes! It results in a super crispy thin crust! Why have 1 thick pizza when
you can have 4 thin pizzas? Thats 4 times as many vegetables!

### Recipe

** ~ Dough ~ **

This is for one batch of dough which can make 4 thin crust pizzas
- 2 cups flour
- 1 cup water
- 8g yeast, or 1 pack fleishmans yeast
- teaspoon of sugar

** ~ Sauces ~ **

*Option 1: Garlic and chilli*

* *This is one pizza worth*

- 2 TableSpoons Olive Oil
- 5 minced garlic cloves
- 1 cherry pepper or wiri wiri pepper

*Option 2: Pesto*

* *makes a large portion of pesto sauce*

- 2 cups packed basil leaves
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1/4 cup pine nuts or walnuts
- 2/3 cup olive oil
- 3 table spoons plant parm or parmageddon or make your own plant parm using nutritional yeast(will figure this out in future)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- half teaspoon pepper

Blend!

Option 3: Passata

This is one pizza's worth
- 2 Table Spoons Olive Oil
- 4 Table Spoons Passata
- 5 Minced Garlic Cloves
- half a medium sized onion, minced

### Method

** ~ Pre ~ **

1. Pre-Heat oven to 500F. I would try with even hotter, but this is the highest my oven goes!
2. If you are using any wet vegetables or mushrooms, Cut them up and place on a rack in the oven to dehydrate
This will help the pizza crust up properly!

** ~ Dough ~ **

1. Start with half a cup of tap-warm water. (I currently live in Toronto so we have the best tap-water in the world :p)
2. Add the yeast and sugar. Give a lil stir. The sugar is food for your yeast! If your yeast is not expired or dead, it will begin to foam up in about a minute or two.
3. Let it sit for 8 more minutes. There should be a lot of foam!
4. Add the flour, yeast water, and remaining half of cup water to a large bowl and mix.
5. Cover the bowl with a cloth and let sit for another 20-30 minutes.
6. During this waiting time, you can prep any vegetables
7. Knead the risen dough another minute and that's it, the hardest part of pizza is done.

** ~ Roll out and Decorate ~ **

1. Heres the secret rolling technique. Begin Rolling the dough on a clean surface. Focus on the round shape, flouring each side only initially.
Then, continue rolling it out, but do not flip it. let the underside stick to the surface, and focus on rolling it out super thin.
Continue to apply flour to the top to prevent your rolling pin (or wine bottle) from sticking to it.
Continue until you have reach a size slightly larger than your cast iron pan.
2. Apply some olive oil to the pan. Be slightly generous.
3. Transfer the dough into the pan now. This could be tricky. It it falls apart, just get it all in there and press the dough back together. Roll the dough up the edges.
4. Spread your sauce over the dough. When using passata sauce, a generous amount helps keep vegetables in place.
5. Add your vegetables! Put the wetter ones on the outside near the criust edge, so they will dry out faster.
6. Bake in the oven for about 15 minutes, or until desured crust crunchyness. I use a long knife to lift up the crust as a test to see its rigidy.
