A sweet Indian dessert made from carrots that is actually healthy!

**_Servings_** : 4-8 depending on serving size
**_Prep-time_** : 30 min
**_Cook time_** : 30 min
**_Total time_** : 60 min

### Recipe

- 4 cups shredded carrot(thickest organic carrots you can find) ü•ï
- 4 cups almond milk ü•õ
- 12 cashews or 18g of cashews
- 4 dates üíï
- crushed seeds of 6 green cardamom üíö
- 1 tsp peanut oil (optional) ü•ú

### Method

1. Peel and grate the carrots. I use my blender to speed this up and also since
   I don't have a large grater. You'll see here roughly how large I chunk it so
   that my blender can handle it.

2. Here you can see my blender is not so wide on the bottom so I do small
   batches so that my blender can handle it. If you have a food processor, that may
   be better. You are looking to get a shredded consistency, so don't blend too
   long and blend on low speed.

4. If you are using oil, add it to your wok or similar large pot. Add the
   shredded carrots and fry for a few minutes. Else, just add the shredded carrots

5. Now add all the almond milk and bring to high heat. You will be reducing it
   down now for quite some time, until the mixture is not liquid anymore basically.
   During this time you will also prep the final ingredients.

6. Crush your green cardamom to get the seeds out and crush them into powder
   using the mortar pestle. The fragrance from these whole spices are amazing! You
   can use pre-ground powder as well but you should double up then because it is
   not as strong as freshly ground.

7. Check on your mixture make sure its not sticking, perhaps reduce to medium
   heat and let it simmer. Now soak your cashews and dates in hot water for 20
   minutes. You can then blend it into a nice smooth paste üòç

8. This is roughly what the texture should be like. No more liquid. So far from
   my experience, the vegan version does not stay so orange perhaps due to the
   almond milk -- but I assure you it will TASTE AMAZING. I prefer my halwa not
   too sweet so that I can eat more of it, so 4 dates is good for me, but if you
   prefer sweeter, just add more dates or sugar or agave ect. You may also like
   to add a pinch of salt.
