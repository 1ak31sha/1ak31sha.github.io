Hearty and simple yet Flavourful Scrambled Tofu!

This dish is so delicious and comforting! Its packed with protein, no LDL cholesterol, and Tofu has a much longer expiry date than eggs, so its easy to keep the 
ingredients on hand!

#### Recipe

- Medium size onion
- 4 garlic cloves
- 1 tablespoon avocado oil or other high smoke point oil
- 3/4 package of firm tofu
- one of your best tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground Cumin
- 1 teaspoon Salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground Thyme
- half a Thai bird chili (optional)

### Method

** ~ Prep the vegetables ~ **

1. Dice your onion and tomatoe, mince your garlic. If you are using hot pepper, chop that up too.

2. Add the oil to your pan. Set stove to high to get oil heated quickly, then bring it back down to 4/10

3. Add in the onion. Fry until translucent

4. Then add in the garlic. Fry for another minute or until fragrant. Do not let in get brown.

5. Add in the tomatoe. Add the whole thing, not to loose any juices.
If you have frozen tomatoes, just microwave on a plate for 4 minutes.
Then mash it down with a potatoe masher or something.

6. Add the chilli pepper now as well if using.

7. Add the Salt, black pepper, Cumin and Thyme.

8. Start crumbling in your tofu.

9. Sprinkle the Tumeric powder over the tofu now to give it that color(and also its anti-inflamatory and anti-oxidant properties!)

10. Mix everything down and cook for a couple more minutes, until all liquid is absorbed/evaporated.


** ~Its done!~ **

Well, it probably is, but do a taste test, and adjust the salt or spices to your liking
