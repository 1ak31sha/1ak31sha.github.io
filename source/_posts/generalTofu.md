### Recipe

### Method

1. Defrost double frozen tofu. Press out water and soak in chicken style vegan
broth. Coat in seasoning. I find that if i press on it a bit on each side, i can
make the broth ooze out a lil and help to absorb some more seasoning onto the
coating. Bake on well oiled stone or pan at 400F for about 40 minutes.
2. Chop red onion, garlic, bell peppers.
