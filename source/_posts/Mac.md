### Recipe

#### Boiling ingredients

- 1/4 cup cashews
- 1 peeled Yukon gold potato 🥔
- 1/4 cup carrots 🥕
- 1/3 cup onion
- 1 clove of garlic

#### Blender ingredients

- 1 teaspoon pink salt :pink:
- 1/4 cup coconut milk(from a can so its got that cream) 🥥
 Note: with the extra coconut milk i like to make overnight oats/ chia seed pudding
- 1 table spoon lemon juice, or roughly half a small lemon. 🍋
- 3 tablespoons nutritional yeast(nooch) 🧀
- pinch cayenne pepper(optional) 🌶
- pinch paprika(optional)

#### And the other ingredients

- 1 medium head of broccoli 🥦
- one package(about 2 cups) mushrooms 🍄 of your choice
- 2 table spoons taco 🌮 seasoning
- 250 grams of your fave pasta noodle 🌽 (mine is fusilli). I usually use dried 100% durum wheat
  noodles which are simple to cook, but feel free to use gluten free.

### Method

1. Place all boiling ingredients in a medium to large pot and add enough water
just to cover them. Bring to a boil and reduce to medium heat to simmer for
about 20 minutes or until potato is soft. Move on to next steps during this time.
2. Chop your broccoli into small
pieces and place in a strainer over your boiling ingredients to steam it. 🚂
3. Rinse your pasta noodles and cook in 'salty like the sea' water until desired softness. 🍝
4. Chop your mushrooms and put them in a pan with medium heat to cook. Season
with taco style seasoning or whatever else you like. Mushrroms taste great on
their own, just some salt might be good for you or if you dont have the taco
seasoning. Oil to fry them in is optional, I find mushrooms don't really stick
to the pan so I skip the oil since its actually not a health food.
5. When potatoes are soft, the boiling ingredients are ready to be blended. Add
the Blending ingredients as well.  Blend on high for a good couple minutes to
get a smooth texture. Smooth and Shiny ✨
6. Now add everything together! More salt and nooch to taste.
