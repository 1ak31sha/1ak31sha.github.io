A spicy sauce made originally from Peri Peri peppers that goes great on so many things

***Servings***: Almost a Liter of sauce
***Prep-time***: 10 mins
***Cook time***: 30 mins

### Recipe

- 3 Red Bell Pepper 🔔
- 5 Peri Peri Peppers or Thai Bird Chillies 🌶
- Zest of 1 small Lemon 🍋
- Juice of 2 small Lemons 🍋
- 1 teaspoon Sage 👵
- 1 teaspoon Paprika
- 1 teaspoon Oregano
- 1 teaspoon Black Pepper
- 0.5 teaspoon Pink Salt
- 0.25 cup White Wine Vinegar 🍷
- 0.25 cup Grape seed oil or Olive oil (will test this oil free in future) 🍇
- 1 red Onion
- 3 cloves Garlic
- 1 tablespoon coconut sugar 🌴 or agave syrup (I'm going to try this with Dates next time, will let you know how it goes)

### Method

Perform in this order for max efficiency:

1. Get your Oven first to start preheating @390F. If you have a fire oven, even better!

2. Chop your Red Bell Peppers in half and deseed them. Cut the stem off your
Peri Peri /Bird chillies and leave the seeds. 5 chillies may seem like its gonna
be hot but its really not that bad. If you have really low tolerance, deseed a
few. But I mean, its hot sauce after all. Place the hot peppers and Bell peppers
skin up on a pizza stone or baking sheet and get them in the oven for about 30
minutes. Let them get a little black on the outside, we will be removing the
skin anyways.

3. Chop your onions and garlic.  Doesn't have to be super fine, we will blend it
later anyways. Fry it in a table spoon of the oil(remove this from the 0.25 cup allocation), adding garlic second since it
browns faster. Don't let the garlic get brown. Then add it to your blender, including the oil.

4. Get the rest of the ingredients into the Blender. My trick for squeezing
lemons is to squeeze it right into the palm of your hand to catch the seeds, and
let the juice run through your fingers. No need for useless extra lemon squeezer
taking up space in your drawer! Get fresh herbs if you can! Good ingredients are
key to good tasting food. I made it with dried spices though and it still tasted
great.

5. When the Bell peppers are getting black you will see the skin separating as
well! Remove the peppers from the oven and place on a chopping board to make it easy
to scrape the skin off. Do this because a) its bitter, b) allows you to get that
roasted flavor of the pepper without the cancerous carbon. Add the pepper flesh into the blender

Heres some [double frozen tofu](https://www.lakeisha.ca/double-frozen-tofu/)! that i baked with the Peri Peri sauce. It was as amazing as it looks!

I've also used it in a stir fry, and even on plain lentils to spice it up.
