        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hearty and simple yet Flavourful Scrambled Tofu!</p><p>This dish is so delicious, I promise you will prefer it over scrambled eggs<br>It also has more protein, no LDL cholesterol, and Tofu has a much longer expiry date, so its easy to keep the<br>ingredients on hand!</p><h4 id="Recipe"><a href="#Recipe" class="headerlink" title="Recipe"></a>Recipe</h4><ul><li>Medium size onion</li><li>4 garlic cloves</li><li>1 tablespoon avocodo oil or other high smoke point oil</li><li>3/4 package of firm tofu</li><li>one of your best tomatoes</li><li>1 teaspoon ground tumeric</li><li>1 teaspoon ground Cumin</li><li>1 teaspoon Salt</li><li>1/2 teaspoon ground Thyme</li><li>half a thai bird chilli (optional)</li></ul><p>Dice your onion and tomatoe, and mince your garlic (and chilli if using)<br>The reason i recommned a good tomatoe, is that I find this is one of the vegetables where<br>organic or better yet homegrown, makes a huge difference<br>Add the oil. Set stove to high to get oil heated quickly, then bring it back down to 4/10<br>If your oil smokes(perhaps you are using olive or veg oil) throw it out and start again<br>Add in your onion first. Fry for a few min, then add in the garlic. Fry for another minute.<br>Add in the tomatoe. I add the whole thing, skin and all. I chop it in hand over a plate, as to not loose any juices to my wooden cutting board<br>If you have frozen tomatoes, just microwave on a plate for 4 minutes and do the same<br>Add the chilli pepper now as well if using. I just use half since i dont want to overpower the other flavours, but if you are in the mood for it, add the whole thing! or maybe 2 chillies!<br>While you are letting it cook down for a few minutes, you can start adding the spices<br>Add the Salt, black pepper, Cumin and Thyme.<br>Then, start crumbling in your tofu.<br>Sprinkle the Tumeric powder over the tofu now to give it that color(and also its anti-inflamatory and anti-oxidant properties!)<br>Mix everything down and cook for a couple more minutes, until all tomatoe juice is absorbed/evaporated</p><p>Its done! Well, it probably is, but do a taste test, and adjust the salt or spices to your liking</p>]]></content>
