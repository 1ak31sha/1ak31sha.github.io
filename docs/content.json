It results in a super crispy thin crust! Why have 1 thick pizza when you can have 4 thin pizzas? Thats 4 times as many vegetables!

Option 3: Passata base -&gt; This is one pizza‚Äôs worth 2 Table Spoons Olive Oil 4 Table Spoons Passataü•´ 5 Minced Garlic Cloves half a medium sized onion, minced Method ~ Pre ~ Pre-Heat oven to 500Füå°. I would try with even hotter, but this is the highest my oven goes! If you are using any wet vegetables or mushrooms, Cut them up and place on a rack in the oven to dehydrateThis will help the pizza crust up properly! ~ Dough ~ Start with half a cup of tap-warm water, Add the yeast and sugar. Give a lil stir. The sugar is food for your yeast! If your yeast is not expired or dead, it will begin to foam up in about a minute or two. Let it sit for 8 more minutes. There should be a lot of foam! Add the flour, yeast water, and remaining half of cup water to a large bowl and mix. Cover the bowl with a cloth and let sit for another 20-30 minutes. During this waiting time, you can prep any vegetables Knead the risen dough another minute and that‚Äôs it, the hardest part of pizza is done. ~ Roll out and Decorate ~ *There are two ways I make the pizza. one is rolling the dough on parchment paper and cooking on a pizza stone, the other just uses a cast iron pan. Heres the secret rolling technique. Begin Rolling the dough flouring each side only initially. Then, continue rolling it out, but do not flip it. let the underside stick to the surface. Continue to apply flour to the top to prevent your rolling pin (or wine bottle) from sticking to it. This will allow you to get an ultra thin crust! Continue until you have reach a size slightly larger than your cast iron pan. Apply some olive oil to the pan. Be slightly generous. If using parchment paper, no need. Transfer the dough into the pan now. This could be tricky, and make sure not to burn yourself on the pan. It it falls apart, just get it all in there and press the dough back together. Roll the dough up the edges. If using parchment paper, just leave it on the paper and move the whole thing onto your stone after it is decorated (after steps 4,5,6) Spread your sauce over the dough. When using passata or pesto sauce, a generous amount helps keep vegetables in place. Add your vegetables! Put the wetter ones on the outside near the criust edge, so they will dry out faster. Bake in the oven for about 15 minutes, or until desured crust crunchiness. I use a long knife to lift up the crust as a test to see its rigidy. ~ Veg Ideas ~ Olives, tomatoes üçÖ, oregano, red onions, mushrooms. üòçüòçüòçThin Sweet potatoe slicesüç†, Pineapple stuffed crustüçç, Green peppers.
