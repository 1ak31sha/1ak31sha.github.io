This dish is so delicious and comforting! Its packed with protein, no LDL cholesterol, and Tofu has a much longer expiry date than eggs, so its easy to keep theingredients on hand! Recipe Medium size onion 4 garlic cloves 1 tablespoon avocado oil or other high smoke point oil 3/4 package of firm tofu one of your best tomatoes 1 teaspoon ground turmeric 1 teaspoon ground Cumin 1 teaspoon Salt 1/2 teaspoon ground Thyme half a Thai bird chili (optional) Method ~ Prep the vegetables ~ Dice your onion and tomatoe, mince your garlic. If you are using hot pepper, chop that up too. Add the oil to your pan. Set stove to high to get oil heated quickly, then bring it back down to 4/10 Add in the onion. Fry until translucent Then add in the garlic. Fry for another minute or until fragrant. Do not let in get brown. Add in the tomatoe. Add the whole thing, not to loose any juices.If you have frozen tomatoes, just microwave on a plate for 4 minutes.Then mash it down with a potatoe masher or something. Add the chilli pepper now as well if using. Add the Salt, black pepper, Cumin and Thyme. Start crumbling in your tofu. Sprinkle the Tumeric powder over the tofu now to give it that color(and also its anti-inflamatory and anti-oxidant properties!) Mix everything down and cook for a couple more minutes, until all liquid is absorbed/evaporated. ~Its done!~ Well, it probably is, but do a taste test, and adjust the salt or spices to your liking","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"breakfast","slug":"breakfast","permalink":"https://www.lakeisha.ca/tags/breakfast/"}]},{"title":"La Pizza","slug":"Pizza","date":"2018-10-29T05:00:00.000Z","updated":"2018-11-09T19:08:09.619Z","comments":true,"path":"la-pizza/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.lakeisha.ca/la-pizza/","excerpt":"","text":"Find out my secret technique to making a cripsy Thin crust pizza! Servings: 1-4 medium thin-crust pizzasPrep-time: 30 minCook time: 15 min per pizza The pizza dough is a standard recipe, but its the cooking technique that really makes this pizza stand out as one of my favorite personally developed recipes! It results in a super crispy thin crust! Why have 1 thick pizza when you can have 4 thin pizzas? Thats 4 times as many vegetables! Recipe ~ Dough ~ This is for one batch of dough which can make 4 thin crust pizzas 2 cups flour 1 cup water💦 8g yeast, or 1 pack fleishmans yeast🍞 teaspoon of sugar pinch of salt ~ Sauces ~ Option 1: Garlic and chili -&gt; This is for one pizza’s worth of sauce 2 TableSpoons Olive Oil 5 minced garlic cloves 1 cherry pepper or wiri wiri pepper🌶 Option 2: Pesto -&gt; makes a large portion of pesto sauce 2 cups packed basil leaves🍃 2 cloves garlic 1/4 cup pine nuts or walnuts 2/3 cup olive oil 3 table spoons plant parm or parmageddon or make your own plant parm using nutritional yeast(will figure this out in future) 1 teaspoon salt half teaspoon pepper Blend! Option 3: Passata base -&gt; This is one pizza’s worth 2 Table Spoons Olive Oil 4 Table Spoons Passata🥫 5 Minced Garlic Cloves half a medium sized onion, minced Method ~ Pre ~ Pre-Heat oven to 500F🌡. I would try with even hotter, but this is the highest my oven goes! If you are using any wet vegetables or mushrooms, Cut them up and place on a rack in the oven to dehydrateThis will help the pizza crust up properly! ~ Dough ~ Start with half a cup of tap-warm water. (I currently live in Toronto so we have the best tap-water in the world :p) Add the yeast and sugar. Give a lil stir. The sugar is food for your yeast! If your yeast is not expired or dead, it will begin to foam up in about a minute or two. Let it sit for 8 more minutes. There should be a lot of foam! Add the flour, yeast water, and remaining half of cup water to a large bowl and mix. Cover the bowl with a cloth and let sit for another 20-30 minutes. During this waiting time, you can prep any vegetables Knead the risen dough another minute and that’s it, the hardest part of pizza is done. ~ Roll out and Decorate ~ *There are two ways I make the pizza. one is rolling the dough on parchment paper and cooking on a pizza stone, the other just uses a cast iron pan. Heres the secret rolling technique. Begin Rolling the dough flouring each side only initially. Then, continue rolling it out, but do not flip it. let the underside stick to the surface. Continue to apply flour to the top to prevent your rolling pin (or wine bottle) from sticking to it. This will allow you to get an ultra thin crust! Continue until you have reach a size slightly larger than your cast iron pan. Apply some olive oil to the pan. Be slightly generous. If using parchment paper, no need. Transfer the dough into the pan now. This could be tricky, and make sure not to burn yourself on the pan. It it falls apart, just get it all in there and press the dough back together. Roll the dough up the edges. If using parchment paper, just leave it on the paper and move the whole thing onto your stone after it is decorated (after steps 4,5,6) Spread your sauce over the dough. When using passata or pesto sauce, a generous amount helps keep vegetables in place. Add your vegetables! Put the wetter ones on the outside near the criust edge, so they will dry out faster. Bake in the oven for about 15 minutes, or until desured crust crunchiness. I use a long knife to lift up the crust as a test to see its rigidy. ~ Veg Ideas ~ Olives, tomatoes 🍅, oregano, red onions, mushrooms. 😍😍😍Thin Sweet potatoe slices🍠, Pineapple stuffed crust🍍, Green peppers.

This curry paste will resemble a Red Thai curry, but its color can vary depending on your pepper choice. RecipeEqual parts of: Galangal (never heard of it? pictures below) Fresh Turmeric Onion Garlic Lemongrass Keffir Lime rind (or keffir lime leaves if you cant find) Dried red chillies 🌶 (omit if you’re going for a green curry) Fresh hot peppers of your liking (I like to use wiri wiri, but Thai bird chillies are the OG) Fresh Ginseng (I’ve yet to find this in Toronto and have always omitted it.) Half portion compared with above ingredients: Coriander seeds Your choice of oil. I recommend grapeseed🍇. MethodWhen I make this, I try to make as much as possible! So I choose an ingredient size that will fill my blender to the top. Cut the ingredients into small pieces so that they will blender easier, unless you have a beast of a blender! Add everything to your blender and blend well! Try to get it blended to the point where there are no more strands of lemongrass fiber. Add a bit more oil or water if you need to help it blend. MY blender comes with a plastic rod that I jam into the blender while its going to push everything down and help it along. Store in fridge. Can last at least 3 weeks. GalangalThis one can be hard to find. Sometimes the TNT on Cherry Road has it, but the TNT in mississauaga is more a gaurantee. You can also try Sunny’s or Bestco or any other Chinese/Thai Grocery stores.The taste is quite different than Ginger. Its more sweet and bitter rather than spicy like ginger. It can also be called Thai Ginger.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"thai","slug":"thai","permalink":"https://www.lakeisha.ca/tags/thai/"},{"name":"curry","slug":"curry","permalink":"https://www.lakeisha.ca/tags/curry/"},{"name":"spicy","slug":"spicy","permalink":"https://www.lakeisha.ca/tags/spicy/"}]},{"title":"Thai Larb","slug":"ThaiLarb","date":"2018-10-28T05:00:00.000Z","updated":"2018-11-09T18:58:31.815Z","comments":true,"path":"thai-larb/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.lakeisha.ca/thai-larb/","excerpt":"","text":"This TVP based salad features Mint, Lime, Culantro, Agave, and hot peppers!
