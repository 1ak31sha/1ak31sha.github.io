Cheaper and better for Earth. 2-4 adobo peppers 2 garlic 1 cup black beans handful sundried tomatoes (not in oil - i find these at whole foods) 5-6 tortilla wraps. @Wholefoods has some really good vegan ones like spinach or sun-dried tomato Avocado Cream (optional) 3/4 cup raw cashews 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves 1 large garlic clove 1/2 cup water, or as needed 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice 2 tablespoons avocado 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder Method Chop the sweet potato into small cubes and put the on a pizza stone(no oil) and bake @420 F for ~30 minutes. If you dont have a pizza stone, try parchment paper or maybe resort to a bit of oil. If you have an instant pot or pressure cooker, get your black beans ready too. I usually do 30 minutes from dry in the insta. You can use canned otherwise. Get started with the sauce. Get the broth in your pot and put it on medium to low heat. Add all the other ingredients and cook for 5-10 minutes until everything is mixed well. Salt to taste and turn off heat. Add the chopped onion,spinach, garlic and adobo peppers to a wok or large pot and cook on medium to low until onions are to your liking. The Sweet potato and black beans should be about done by now. Add these and the rest on the ingredients and cook another 3-5 minutes. Spread a layer of your enchilada sauce on the bottom of a deep baking dish. Put a scoop of filling on each enchilada and roll them up. Get them in the dish and pour the remaining sauce on them. Bake at 350 for 30 mins. If you are doing the avocado cream, now is the time. Soak the cashews in hot water for at least 15 minutes up to an hour. Put all ingredients in a blender and blend long time till smooth. Damn, my mouth is watering just after writing this recipe down. Its really notthat much work and is super comforting food and super healthy too. Also, thisdish does really well as leftovers, some people might even prefer it reheated.So its a great meal prep candidate. Good way to get that spinach too. I startedusing the whole bunch of spinach in an effort not to let anything go bad and toget more vitamins - and it still taste great! The spinach wilts down a lotanyways, so 1 cup isn‚Äôt that much, which is what the original recipe called for. you can bake it without the sauce to get it cripsier and add the sauce after and then bake a lil more. https://ohsheglows.com/2016/02/01/next-level-vegan-enchiladas/","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Mexican","slug":"Mexican","permalink":"https://www.lakeisha.ca/tags/Mexican/"},{"name":"Leftovers","slug":"Leftovers","permalink":"https://www.lakeisha.ca/tags/Leftovers/"}]},{"title":"Double frozen Tofu","slug":"Doublefrozentofu","date":"2019-09-13T04:16:00.000Z","updated":"2019-09-13T03:21:07.017Z","comments":true,"path":"double-frozen-tofu/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.lakeisha.ca/double-frozen-tofu/","excerpt":"","text":"The best way to make tofu.

Thaw it again when you are ready to use it. I like to keep to a bunch of tofupacks that were frozen and thawed once in the freeze so they are ready to gowhen i want tofu! You can also use the thaw function on your microwave if you dont have time to wait. Open the tofu pack and drain the water. Press the tofu.

Once most the water ispressed, i take it out and press it further with myhands, carefully not to break the tofu. Slice you tofu into cubes, or whatever you want. For chicken pieces style,rip it into pieces, allowing it to rip naturally in the cracks that it has. Season your tofu. Some suggestions below! Paneer style 2 tablespoon nutritional yeast 1 teaspoon white pepper water Add all ingredients and enough water to form some liquid, roughly equal to the volume of your tofu. take each piece of tofu and dip it in your liquid seasoning.

I would try with even hotter, but this is the highest my oven goes! If you are using any wet vegetables or mushrooms, Cut them up and place on a rack in the oven to dehydrateThis will help the pizza crust up properly! ~ Dough ~ Start with half a cup of tap-warm water, Add the yeast and sugar. Give a lil stir. The sugar is food for your yeast! If your yeast is not expired or dead, it will begin to foam up in about a minute or two. Let it sit for 8 more minutes. There should be a lot of foam! Add the flour, yeast water, and remaining half of cup water to a large bowl and mix. Cover the bowl with a cloth and let sit for another 20-30 minutes. During this waiting time, you can prep any vegetables Knead the risen dough another minute and that‚Äôs it, the hardest part of pizza is done. ~ Roll out and Decorate ~ *There are two ways I make the pizza. one is rolling the dough on parchment paper and cooking on a pizza stone, the other just uses a cast iron pan. Heres the secret rolling technique. Begin Rolling the dough flouring each side only initially. Then, continue rolling it out, but do not flip it. let the underside stick to the surface. Continue to apply flour to the top to prevent your rolling pin (or wine bottle) from sticking to it. This will allow you to get an ultra thin crust! Continue until you have reach a size slightly larger than your cast iron pan. Apply some olive oil to the pan. Be slightly generous. If using parchment paper, no need. Transfer the dough into the pan now. This could be tricky, and make sure not to burn yourself on the pan. It it falls apart, just get it all in there and press the dough back together. Roll the dough up the edges. If using parchment paper, just leave it on the paper and move the whole thing onto your stone after it is decorated (after steps 4,5,6) Spread your sauce over the dough. When using passata or pesto sauce, a generous amount helps keep vegetables in place. Add your vegetables! Put the wetter ones on the outside near the criust edge, so they will dry out faster. Bake in the oven for about 15 minutes, or until desured crust crunchiness. I use a long knife to lift up the crust as a test to see its rigidy. ~ Veg Ideas ~ Olives, tomatoes üçÖ, oregano, red onions, mushrooms. üòçüòçüòçThin Sweet potatoe slicesüç†, Pineapple stuffed crustüçç, Green peppers.

This curry paste will resemble a Red Thai curry, but its color can vary depending on your pepper choice. RecipeEqual parts of: Galangal (never heard of it? pictures below) Fresh Turmeric Onion Garlic Lemongrass Keffir Lime rind (or keffir lime leaves if you cant find) Dried red chillies üå∂ (omit if you‚Äôre going for a green curry) Fresh hot peppers of your liking (I like to use wiri wiri, but Thai bird chillies are the OG) Fresh Ginseng (I‚Äôve yet to find this in Toronto and have always omitted it.) Half portion compared with above ingredients: Coriander seeds Your choice of oil. I recommend grapeseedüçá. MethodWhen I make this, I try to make as much as possible! So I choose an ingredient size that will fill my blender to the top. Cut the ingredients into small pieces so that they will blender easier, unless you have a beast of a blender! Add everything to your blender and blend well! Try to get it blended to the point where there are no more strands of lemongrass fiber. Add a bit more oil or water if you need to help it blend. MY blender comes with a plastic rod that I jam into the blender while its going to push everything down and help it along. Store in fridge. Can last at least 3 weeks. GalangalThis one can be hard to find. Sometimes the TNT on Cherry Road has it, but the TNT in mississauaga is more a gaurantee. You can also try Sunny‚Äôs or Bestco or any other Chinese/Thai Grocery stores.The taste is quite different than Ginger. Its more sweet and bitter rather than spicy like ginger. It can also be called Thai Ginger.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"thai","slug":"thai","permalink":"https://www.lakeisha.ca/tags/thai/"},{"name":"curry","slug":"curry","permalink":"https://www.lakeisha.ca/tags/curry/"},{"name":"spicy","slug":"spicy","permalink":"https://www.lakeisha.ca/tags/spicy/"}]},{"title":"Thai Larb","slug":"ThaiLarb","date":"2018-10-28T05:00:00.000Z","updated":"2018-11-09T18:58:31.815Z","comments":true,"path":"thai-larb/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.lakeisha.ca/thai-larb/","excerpt":"","text":"This TVP based salad features Mint, Lime, Culantro, Agave, and hot peppers!
